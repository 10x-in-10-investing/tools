This Excel workbook calculates the detrended fitted P/E ratio based on user-defined inputs.  The user defines the data range to be fit, whether to adjust the S&P 500 earnings and prices for inflation, and chooses between a linear and non-linear model. The data in the "Detrended P/E fitted" column is the key metric.  The raw data is obtained from Dr. Shiller's website.

The user can update the ratio based on current S&P 500 values.  Also, the user can work backwards by setting target ratios and calculating the S&P 500 index value that results in the target ratio.

This tool was introduced in the video, [10x in 10 Market Guide](https://youtu.be/ixSErDDgccM).
